<h2>About</h2>
This repository hosts an implementation of the get_next_line function in C. The get_next_line function is a vital tool in file input/output operations, enabling the program to read one line at a time from a file or an input source until it reaches the end of the file. This function dynamically allocates memory for each line, ensuring efficient memory usage.

Key Features:

•Efficient Line-by-Line Reading: Reads one line at a time from files or input streams, optimizing data processing by handling information incrementally.

•Dynamic Memory Allocation: Dynamically allocates memory for each line, promoting efficient memory usage, even when dealing with extensive text files.

•Memory Resource Management: Process large text files line by line without straining the system's memory, ensuring smooth operation.

•Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrate into a variety of C projects involving file operations, providing a reliable solution for reading files.

•Improved Code Structure: Enhance code readability and maintainability by encapsulating file reading logic within a modular function, promoting organized and comprehensible code.

Feel free to explore the repository, experiment with the code, and seamlessly incorporate this efficient line-reading function into your projects. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for enhancements, your contributions are highly appreciated!
